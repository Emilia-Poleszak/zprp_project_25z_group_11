## Scientific papers and articles analysis
1. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-Term_Memory

**Comment:** 

Section 1: Introduction of LSTM
Section 2: Review of previous works on recurrent nets with time-varying inputs
Section 3: Explains constant error backdrop – problem that LSTM is supposed to solve
Section 4: Description of LSTM architecture (the project will use newer implementation (proposed by PyTorch))
Section 5 describes experiments demonstrating the quality of a novel long time lag algorithm. The task, architecture, training and results are described.
Section 6 includes discussion on limitations of LSTM. The project will include comparison of how LRU performs against those limitations.

**Details:**

No code and pre-trained models are available.
Metrics included in evaluations of experiments 1, 4, 5 are: 
percentage of success trials, number of sequance presentations until success, MSE, “# wrong predictions” (numer of incorrectly precessed sequences”

Data used: 
-	experiment 1: 256 training and test strings, generated randomly,
-	experiment 4: pair of components (a real value randomly chosen from [-1; 1] and one of values {-1, 0, 1},
-	experiment 5: same as 4, but first component is from interval [0; 1].

**Comment:**

Paper explores another solution to the vanishing gradient problem. 
Performs experiments to test unitary recurrent matrices. 
In context of our project it provides theoretical background for the issue.

**Details:**

Code: https://github.com/stwisdom/urnn 
Data used: synthetic + MNIST
Metrics: gradient norms, hidden state norms, distance to last state, 
accuracy (for classification), MSE, cross entropy.

**Comment:**
	
This paper describes LSTM disadvantages in learning long-term dependencies. 
Main issues are caused by vanishing gradients and short-term gradient value domination. 
This is a good groundwork for network architecture development.	

- No official models/implementations found, 
however there is a project that tackles the same problem:

-	No implementation found;
-	Metrics: successful sequence prediction percentage, 
effective learning and testing time
-	Computing resources: MacBook Pro with Python scientific stack
